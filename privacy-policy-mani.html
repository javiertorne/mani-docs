        <h1>Privacy Policy for Mani</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Mani is designed from the ground up with your privacy in mind:</strong></p>
            <p><span class="checkmark">✅</span> <strong>Your financial data never leaves your devices</strong> (except for secure synchronization with your private iCloud)</p>
            <p><span class="checkmark">✅</span> <strong>No registration or user account required</strong></p>

            <p><span class="checkmark">✅</span> <strong>The source code is private but the App operates transparently</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        
        <p>Mani has been specifically designed to NOT collect personal information. We do not collect:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="cross">❌</span> Name, email, or contact details</li>
            <li><span class="cross">❌</span> Location information</li>

            <li><span class="cross">❌</span> Access to your camera, photos, contacts, or microphone</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Information You Store Locally on Your Device</h2>
        
        <p>The App allows you to create and manage the following financial information, which is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Financial Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Amounts, descriptions, dates, types (income/expense), split expense information</li>
            <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Names and emojis of custom categories</li>
            <li><strong>Spending Limits:</strong> Names, amounts, and alert thresholds</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Goals:</strong> Names, target amounts, deadlines, and contributions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 App Preferences</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Onboarding completion status (synchronized via iCloud Key-Value Store)</li>
            <li>User interface settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.3 Storage Technology</h3>
        <p>All this information is stored using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SwiftData:</strong> Apple's data persistence framework that stores information locally on your device</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you have iCloud enabled, your data automatically syncs securely and encrypted with your personal iCloud account so it's available across all your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. iCloud and Data Synchronization</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 How It Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have iCloud enabled on your device, the App uses Apple's <strong>CloudKit</strong> to automatically sync your financial data across all your devices</li>
            <li>This synchronization is completely <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong> and managed by Apple</li>
            <li><strong>We do not have access</strong> to the data stored in your iCloud</li>
            <li>Data remains in your personal iCloud account (container: <code>iCloud.dev.makotostudio.mani</code>)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.2 User Control</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can disable iCloud synchronization at any time from your device settings</li>
            <li>If you disable iCloud, your data will remain only on the local device</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 RevenueCat (Subscription Management)</h3>
        
        <p>To manage the App's PRO subscriptions, we use <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service specialized in in-app purchase management.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Information shared with RevenueCat:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous user identifier generated by RevenueCat</li>
            <li>Your subscription status (active, expired, cancelled)</li>
            <li>Platform and operating system version</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
            <p>RevenueCat does <strong>NOT receive any financial data</strong> from your use of the App (transactions, categories, savings goals, etc.)</p>
            <p>RevenueCat only manages your PRO subscription status</p>
            <p>RevenueCat Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>4.2 Apple (In-App Purchases)</h3>
        
        <p>Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's In-App Purchase system (App Store). Apple may collect payment information according to its own privacy policy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>See Apple's Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></p>
        
        <h3>4.3 Push Notifications (Future Feature)</h3>
        
        <p>The App has the capability configured to send Apple Push Notifications (APNs) for spending limit alerts, but this feature is <strong>not yet implemented</strong>. When activated in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They will only be used to send you alerts related to your spending limits</li>
            <li>No additional information will be collected</li>
            <li>You can disable them at any time from your device settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
        
        <p>The data you store locally in the App is used exclusively to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Display and manage your financial transactions</li>
            <li>Calculate statistics and analysis of your expenses</li>
            <li>Manage your spending limits and savings goals</li>
            <li>Synchronize information across your devices (if you have iCloud enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>We do NOT have access to this data</strong> as it is stored only on your device and in your private iCloud.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Information Sharing</h2>
        
        <p><strong>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The only information that could be shared is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anonymous subscription data with RevenueCat (as described in section 4.1)</li>
            <li>Information required by law (in case of court order or legal requirement)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        
        <h3>7.1 Security Measures</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>All your financial data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData technology, which is protected by device encryption</li>
            <li>iCloud synchronization uses end-to-end encryption</li>
            <li>We do not maintain our own servers with your information</li>
            <li>Subscriptions are securely managed through RevenueCat and Apple</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>7.2 Your Responsibility</h3>
        
        <p>Since your data is stored on your device and iCloud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must protect your device with a password, Touch ID, or Face ID</li>
            <li>You must keep your iCloud account secure</li>
            <li>If you lose access to your iCloud account, we may not be able to help you recover your data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is kept on your device and iCloud <strong>only while you use the App</strong></li>
            <li>If you uninstall the App from all your devices, the data will remain in iCloud for as long as Apple maintains iCloud data according to its policy</li>
            <li>You can manually delete all your data from iCloud by removing the data container from your device's iCloud settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        
        <p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, you have complete control over your information:</p>

            <li>You can delete individual transactions, categories, limits, and goals from the App</li>

                    <li>Go to Settings > [Your name] > iCloud > Manage Storage</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>9.3 Portability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is available on all your Apple devices through iCloud</li>
